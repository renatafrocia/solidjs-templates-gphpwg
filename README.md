# Start the frontend

1. **Install Dependencies**
   First, make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, in the project directory, run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Development Server**
   To start the development server, run:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the Vite development server. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

3. **Building for Production**
   To create a production build, use:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
   This will generate optimized files in the `dist` directory.

4. **Previewing the Production Build**
   To preview the production build locally, run:
   ```
   npm run serve
   ```
   This command will build the Tailwind CSS and start a local server to preview the production build.

5. **Additional Commands**
   - To build Tailwind CSS separately:
     ```
     npm run build-tailwind
     ```
